1. Linear Regression Analysis

File: regression-coefficent.ipynb

Focus: Understanding the relationship between multiple independent variables and a target outcome.
Key Highlights: Manual and automated calculation of Regression Coefficients ($b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$), prediction generation, and model evaluation using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.

2. Supervised Classification Models
   
File: decisiontree-naivebayes-knn.ipynb

Focus: Comparison of popular classification algorithms.
Key Highlights: Implementation of Decision Trees (using entropy/information gain), Naive Bayes (probabilistic classification), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to categorize data based on learned patterns.

4. Clustering Evaluation Metrics

File: Silhouette Davies-Bouldin Calinski-Harabasz ARI MI.ipynb

Focus: Measuring the quality and consistency of unsupervised learning clusters.
Key Highlights: Comprehensive benchmarking of K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering using:Internal Metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.External Metrics: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Mutual Information (MI) to compare results against ground truth labels.Tech Stack Used:Libraries: Scikit-Learn (Metrics & Models), NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
